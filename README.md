# Crawl Google Art and Culture

The python script crawls Google's art and culture webpage: https://artsandculture.google.com/

The website contains artworks from the best 84 galleries all over the world like Musee D'Orsay in Paris or Moma in New York. 

This is the first draft of the crawler for the Google Art Website. The only thing that is still in progress is to show the hidden images.
